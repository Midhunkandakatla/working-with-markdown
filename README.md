# My first hands on experience Working with Markdown 

I am creating a web page using markdown.

I am going to do the following

1. Add a link.
1. Add a List.
1. Customize image
1. Publish content

You can add links to markdown using this syntax `- [link](<Linkgoes here>)` 

For example 

here is link to - [google](https://google.com)
